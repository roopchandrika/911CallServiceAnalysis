# 911CallServiceAnalysis

**Overview**
In this project, I leveraged Spark RDD and Spark SQL to conduct thorough data analysis, employing advanced SQL functions to perform value counts and investigate combinations within target columns for deeper insights.

I executed a range of data preprocessing and transformation tasks, which included cleaning data, selecting features, and training models. My focus was on decision tree classification, along with visualization and feature importance analysis to enhance understanding of the data.

Additionally, I improved emergency response efficiency by prioritizing high-priority calls. Utilizing PySpark, I facilitated rapid implementation and derived actionable insights based on identified patterns.
